# SD_FindThickness
 A compact tool for matching color to 2D material thickness

## Quick start guide:
- 1. Choose the path the graph locate at left panel
(recommend graph: exposure 6ms, auto whitebalance)
- 2. Choose the calibration file:
        
        for example: 
        `~/AFM_measurements/hBN_50X/Cali_hBN_on300nmSiO2_50X`
        
- 3. Continue with following steps
    - First click on Si/SiO2 (purple substrate)
    - Enter `0` in `real_t
    - For each other position you want to extract color:
        - Click `+` to create entry for another point
        - Click on where you want to extract for color
        - The estimated thickness will show up
